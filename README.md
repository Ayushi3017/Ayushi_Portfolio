# Ayushi_Portfolio
 I designed and developed my personal portfolio website from scratch using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean dark theme with subtle animations and responsiveness. Every section—from hero to projects and contact—is crafted to highlight both aesthetics and usability. This project reflects my hands-on approach to learning , experimenting with design and showcasing my skills in an interactive way.

 The file titled Ayu_Portfolio consists of my HTML, CSS and JS code all together forming my portfolio.
